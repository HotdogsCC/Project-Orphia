Orphia is a 2D side scrolling Metroidvania that unfolds the story of a newly freed monster trying to discover the events surrounding her release. Set in a fictional land more reminiscent of an ancient world rather than modern society, players embark on a journey to explore a small yet compact map. As they delve into the eerie and disturbed land, the goal is to comprehend the unfolding narrative, survive encounters with various enemies, and avoid environmental hazards.
